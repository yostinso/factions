# README

Work in progress.

## Current planned features:

* Mod support (mods.factorio.com) with search/download/enable and bulk download to keep local
  installs in sync.

* Faction management (set allies/enemies etc).

## Probably some other stuff?=

* RCON support?

* Map generation / save game management?

* A sister project with all the systemd files I currently use with Factorio?
